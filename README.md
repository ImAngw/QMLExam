# MNIST Classification with Quantum Phase Estimation
is a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning project that leverages Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) to encode digit-specific phases into a quantum circuit. By integrating QPE into a neural architecture, the model learns to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset based on phase-encoded quantum features
